# Neural-Network-Example
Neural Network for interpreting numbers.

This example uses a neural network to take the numbers 0 - 9, as represented by vectors of length 25, and indictates
which digit the network belives the number to be.

The output will assign values to a vector of length 10.
The result [0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] would indicate the number  2 for the appropriate vector after running through the neural network.


This example is to show how neural networks can be used in the area of OCR for reading letters and numbers.
